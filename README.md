## Overview
I built this app with simplicity in mind. Since I have completed this app, I have gotten more familiar with React which has upped my styling comprehension while using it. 
That being said, I wanted this to be what it is. A simple Lyric generator for your favorite lyrics being called from an API that has plenty of popular songs. 

In the futurte, I would like to add some more clean, elegent styling that doesn't take away from my original goal. 
This was a great place to start using APIs within React.
